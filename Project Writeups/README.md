# SageMaker Projects for HCLS
In this course, we have a few different types of projects for you. We have an introduction to data science projects on SageMaker, which is great for people who are net new to machine learning and/or to SageMaker. We also have an advanced data science on SageMaker project, for those of you who want to spend more time learning about advanced SageMaker features for training. We also have a project for operationalizing SageMaker, for those of you who want to focus more on operationalizing SageMaker than necessarily training. All of these projects will start with SageMaker Studio, and utilize SageMaker for both training and hosting, but the big difference is the amount of time you spend on those, where you'll be spending your time, and how you'll frame your final deliverables.

By the end of course tomorrow, you should have a new notebook developed that solves a meaty problem! You should be able to take this notebook back to work with you and drive value for your company and team. Remember, your AWS Solutions Architect is on the ready to help you out, so don't be shy! Ask for help early and often.

And don't forget the secret sauce. Make sure you have some fun!

## Introduction to Data Science on SageMaker
If you are new to data science, or if this is your absolute first SageMaker workshop, you might want to focus on projects in this category. We'll show you a data science problem, tell you how to access that dataset, give you some basic code for cleaning in, then show you how to train a model on SageMaker. Quite a bit of the problem solving is actually on you, however, as we want to help you stretch your data science skills. You'll be asked to perform feature engineering, analyze your data, train multiple models until you find the best approach. 

#### Introductory Data Science Projects
- Predicting Hospital Costs per Patient with Autopilot

## Advanced Data Science on SageMaker
If you've already had a SageMaker workshop before, and you want to focus on advanced SageMaker features for data science, you might pick the `Advanced Data Science on SageMaker` project. This will introduce you to the built-in object detection algorithm, manifest files, Ground Truth, debugger, script-mode, spot instances, experiments, and more! 

This project focuses on XRay analysis. You'll train an object detection algorithm to identiy the throat and trachea within 1000 NIH XRay images.

## SageMaker in Production
A different project is for those who are more interested in putting SageMaker into production. This project focuses more on the operationalizing aspects of SageMaker, such as hosting, autoscaling, automation with Lambda, monitoring, workflow orchestration, and MLOps. You will start with pre-existing model artifacts and training / inference code, and then build a system that highlights the key tenets we need when going into production with SageMaker. This project is called `Hosting and MLOps`.

You'll also get to see how to use both automatic model tuning and AutoGluon to quickly and dramatically improve the performance of your model.

# FAQ's
__1. If I pick a production project, will I still learn how to train a model?__ Yes definitely! You just won't spend all of your time there. You'll spend maybe 15% of your time training a model, but most of your time is on getting those endpoints up and running, then monitoring and updating them.

__2. If I am here to learn about data science, what should I focus on?__ Go ahead and pick a project in the "Introduction to Data Science" category. Generally you'll be learning about how to use Autopilot. 

__3. So I'm going to need to write some of my own code for these?__ Yes, and that's because for the people who want to learn what data science is all about, there's nothing better than attacking your own data set and getting it to work for you. That also goes for the projects about running in production. We'll give you a framework for how to develop these, give you hints, and point to resources, then your AWS Solutions Architect can help you take that project all the way home.

__4. How far should I get on these projects?__ By the end of the day today, you should have stepped through your first lab in your group. Then you should have accessed your data, cleaned it, and started thinking about how to analyze it. These projects are long, and some of the steps will take some time to run, so just get as far as you can. You'll still have most of the day tomorrow to work on them. 

__5. Will I get to see the solutions for these projects?__ Yes! At the end of the session tomorrow, we'll have our experts walk through the solution set.
